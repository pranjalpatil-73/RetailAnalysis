## Project Overview

This project simulates and analyzes the daily sales of a local Kirana (grocery) shop over a 3-month period using Python. It covers data generation, cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) with clear, actionable business insights. Visualizations and metrics were designed to support smarter inventory, supplier, and sales decisions.

---

## Key Objectives

* Generate realistic transaction-level data for a Kirana shop
* Clean and validate data for accurate analysis
* Identify best- and worst-performing products
* Calculate profit margins, monthly sales, and hourly trends
* Visualize insights for decision-making

---

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas – Data manipulation
* Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
* Jupyter Notebook – Workflow documentation & reproducibility

---

## Key Analyses Performed

### Data Generation

* Simulated 3 months of sales data (Oct 2023 to Dec 2023)
* Each record includes: date, time, item, quantity, price, cost, supplier, and bill ID

### Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

* Removed duplicates & invalid entries
* Converted types and parsed timestamps
* Engineered new features: Hour, Month, Total\_Sale, Profit, Profit\_Margin\_%

### Exploratory Data Analysis

* Top-selling products by quantity
* Slow-moving items with least sales
* Monthly sales trends (Oct to Dec 2023)
* Profit by product and supplier
* Hourly sales trends
* Frequent item combinations (basket analysis by bill)

---

## Visualizations

The following charts were generated:

* Top Selling Items
* Monthly Sales Trend
* Profit by Item
* Sales by Hour
* Frequent Item Combinations

Each chart is saved as a .png file for reporting and dashboard use.

## Sample Insights

* Top items sold: Parle-G, Maggi, and Aashirvaad Atta
* Most profitable items: Sunflower Oil and Dettol Soap
* Peak sales hours: 11 AM – 1 PM and 6 PM – 8 PM
